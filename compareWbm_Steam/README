This a script to compare the Rates from wbm(web based monitoring) and steam (*.csv file)

You can copy this folder to a CMSSW area and then after cmsenv do:

source set.(c)sh

python compareWBMTriggerRates2.py 256843 --steamRates test1111.csv --steamL1Rates test2222.csv --targetLumi 2000 --minLS 1083 --maxLS 1191

Then you have two csv files with all the hlt rate and l1 rate comparisons.

You can also change some parameters in compareWBMTriggerRates2.py.
