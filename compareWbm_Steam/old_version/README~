You can copy this folder to a CMSSW area and then after cmsenv do:

source set.csh
python compareWBMTriggerRates.py 254232 --steamRates steam7e33Spring15_dev.csv --targetLumi 7000 --minLS 1 --maxLS 81 > test_254232.csv

Then you have a csv file with all the rate comparisons.

Currently it is pretty rough and several improvements could be made. It doesn't take into account the L1
prescale used in the STEAM prediction (it assumes that it it he 7e33 L1 prescale online). Also, it doesn't try
to do anything smart for paths like HLT_Random, for example, that obviously don't scale with luminosity.
Also, it uses the "rate" number from WBM and not the counts, therefore the WBM number is rounded to
two decimals which makes extrapolations of paths with rates like 0.01 extremely imprecise. And I'm sure
you'll find more things like this if you start looking into it, we just haven't had the time to develop these
things.
