This script is a tool to compare different rate results from *.tsv files.

You can get the comparison by type:

python GoogleDocFill.py

You can set the input files by opening the GoogleDocFill.py and change raleted parameters.
You can also set some parameters in order to suit the different columns of your own input files.

If there are some changes about the same path's name in the two input files, you can add the this path to name_change_map.py. So that the path which has different name in both files will be compared as one path.
